interpolation in vue is done with double curly braces rather than one.

A vue file has three main sections
1. The TEMPLATE, This is where the UI is written, the HTML tags etc like that
2. The SCRIPT, This is where the logic is written and also where exports and imports are called
	it is essentially the javascript file of the application.
3. The STYLE, this section is where the styling takes place really.


The SCRIPT
Inside of the script is where we import and export the files needed for both purposes.
When writing methods, we use the methods object and then write whatever functions that
is needed inside of the template to ensure functionality.

data is more or less like your state.

created is like a useEffect lifecycle method in react, that loads when the component is rendered, also used when dealing with api calls etc hence its similiarity to useEffect.

The data is a function that returns an object, more or less your state.

v-for is what is used to loop through an array or list, usually placed inside of the element that will render the looped results.

v-on is used for event listeners.

v-model is used to link or bind the input change to the state(data)
v-if is used in conditional redndering
v-show is used to either display or not display an element based on a boolean representation
v-for is used for iterating through a list of elements

#emit is used for method or prop forwarding, this basically means passing custom events up the component tree. moving methods from lower component to a high one, the method is called using the custom event that is used to describe it in the component where it is used.
When you've gotten to the said component, yoiu have to set the events being emitted in an array to remove a browser error.
