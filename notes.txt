interpolation in vue is done with double curly braces rather than one.

A vue file has three main sections
1. The TEMPLATE, This is where the UI is written, the HTML tags etc like that
2. The SCRIPT, This is where the logic is written and also where exports and imports are called
	it is essentially the javascript file of the application.
3. The STYLE, this section is where the styling takes place really.


The SCRIPT
Inside of the script is where we import and export the files needed for both purposes.
When writing methods, we use the methods object and then write whatever functions that
is needed inside of the template to ensure functionality.
